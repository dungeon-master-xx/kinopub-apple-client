## Install

The app is distributed as an **unsigned IPA** in [Releases](https://github.com/dungeon-master-office/kinopub-apple-client/releases/latest)
(it's not on the App Store). Install it with AltStore, SideStore, Sideloadly, TrollStore, or sign it
yourself — full step-by-step guide in the **[Wiki](https://github.com/dungeon-master-office/kinopub-apple-client/wiki/Установка)**.

You'll need an active kino.pub subscription; sign in with the on-screen device code.

## Requirements

- iOS / iPadOS **16+**, macOS **13+**
- To build: **Xcode 16+** (Xcode 26 for the iOS 26 Liquid Glass icon & effects)

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dungeon-master-office/kinopub-apple-client.git
cd kinopub-apple-client
open KinoPubAppleClient.xcodeproj
```

In **Signing & Capabilities** pick your team (the repo ships an empty `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` — don't commit
yours), then build & run. To produce an unsigned IPA locally: `./scripts/build-ipa.sh`.
